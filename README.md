<h3> üìå Contribution Guidelines üèó </h3>

Are we missing any of your favorite features, would you like to include  them‚ùì We invite you to contribute to this project and make it better. 
To start contributing, follow these guidelines: 

**1.**  Fork [this](https://github.com/KiranAminPanjwani/Randomized-Color-Lab/fork) repository.

**2.**  Clone your forked copy of the project.

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your_github_user_name>/Randomized-Color-Lab.git
```

**3.** Navigate to the project directory.
```
   cd Randomized-Color-Lab
```

**4.** Create a new branch:
```
   git checkout -b YourBranchName
```

**5.** Make changes in source code and stage.
```
   git add .
```

**6.** Stage your changes and commit
```
   git commit -m "<your_commit_message>"
```

**7.** Push your local commits to the remote repo.

```
   git push origin YourBranchName
```

**8.** Create a [PR](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)

**9.** If anyone contribute to this repository, then the changes will not reflect in your local repository. For that:

**10.** Setup a reference(remote) to the original repository to get all the changes from the remote.
```
   git remote add upstream  https://github.com/KiranAminPanjwani/Randomized-Color-Lab
```

**11.** Check the remotes for this repository.
```
   git remote -v
```

**12.** Fetching from the remote repository will bring in its branches and their respective commits.
```
   git fetch upstream
```

**13.** Make sure that you're on your master branch.
```
   git checkout main
```

**14.** Now that we have fetched the upstream repository, we want to merge its changes into our local branch. This will bring that branch into sync with the upstream, without losing our local changes.
```
   git merge upstream/main
```

<h3> üìå Getting Started with Create React App üí´ </h3>

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

Installs all the packages and libraries used in the project.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
